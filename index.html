    <h1>Life and works</h1>
    <p>
    Samantha Hudson (born as Iván González in September 1999) is a Spanish artist, singer, actress, internet celebrity and LGBT activist. Her work has always been over gender and her relationship with faith and the Catholic church, due to her religious origins.
    </p>
    <p>At 15, Samantha composed her first viral hit and videoclip <pedro class="text-italics">Soy Maricón</pedro>, as homework for school. In <pedro class="text-italics">Soy Maricón</pedro> she argues against the Catholic church and its position regarding sexual diversity in a very explicit language. That got her into some big controversies, being accused of blasphemy by a member of the Balearic Islands Parliament and also the video got to the bishop of Mallorca and got her excommunicated.</p> 
    <p>When she finished highschool, she moved to Barcelona for a short period of time. While there, in 2018 she started a change.org petition in order to claim the remains of the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.</p>
    <p>Since 2019, she lives in Madrid. From the beginning of 2019 she hold a <pedro class="text-italics">drag performance</pedro> in Sala Maravillas, sometimes joined py Paco Clavel, a famous artist from La Movida. Also that same year she released her album <pedro class="text-italics">Los  Grandes Éxitos de Samantha Hudson.</pedro></p>
    <p>In 2021 she released her hew single <pedro class="text-italics">Dulce y Bautizada</pedro> mixed by the queer Spanish artist Putochinomaricón. She also has a new performance on Teatro Lara called "Eutanasia Deluxe", in which she performs her greatest hits. Also she will participate in the next edition of the Spanish version of <pedro class="text-italics">Master Chef Celebrity.</pedro> </p>
